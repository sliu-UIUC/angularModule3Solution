# Chinese Menu Project
* The website is published under github.io: https://sliu-trinity.github.io/angularModule3Solution/
* This website allows you to enter keyword and filter out all Chinese dishes with their description containing the keyword. 
* The project was written in AngularJS(Angular 1) and Javascript. It is deprecated now but it still shares numerous similarities with Angular 2 and a lot of companies are still using it.
* The menu data is published as JSON data on https://davids-restaurant.herokuapp.com/menu_items.json. 
* It's a really dummy project I did to get familar with AngularJS and how it handles JSON data from APIs. I have experience with coding in Angular (Angular 2)
using Typescript before but really havent go into details of Angular in a systematic way. Learning this is certainly helping me 
with coding in Angular 2.
